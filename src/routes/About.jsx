        <h2>About Zoo App</h2>
        <p>
        This react app is named Zoo App. It used Animals, Insects, Birds and Fishes to practice different concepts of react. The application is interactive, we can add likes and reduce them and it shows with counter and when the likes are running lower than zero, the sad emoji (ðŸ˜¢) appears. We may as well cancel the cards and toggle through different animals.
        
        I developed a complete application, incorporating numerous features such as components, hooks, state management, and routing. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of React's core concepts and best practices, significantly enhancing my ability to build dynamic and scalable web applications.
        My take away from this project is that it gave me motivation for the future to pursue further learning through projects like Zoo App. Challenging and yet rewarding!
